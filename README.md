# cs231n_Assignment1_Solution_By_Yash
This repository contains the solution proposed by me for the famous cs231n Stanford Assignment-1. It contains various machine learning techniques like kNN(k-Nearest Neighbor), SVM(Support Vector Machine) precisely Support Vector Classifier, Softmax classifier and Two layer neural network. It has vectorized as well as non-vectorized implementation of each technique mentioned above.

Pros of this assignment:

1) It has both looping and non looping(vectorized) implementation, which gives a complete overview of the whole process of converting it from one form to other.
                    
2) One can see the time difference i.e the time taken by the vectorized implementation was 1/10th of the non vectorized implementation.
                    
3) Backpropagation plays the key role in neural network training which was implemented from the base i.e without using any framework rather calculating derivatives and propagating it backwards using chain rule.
Cons of this assignment:                        

1) For me it took quite some extra time and effort to complete this assignment. Otherwise the content is extraordinary.
